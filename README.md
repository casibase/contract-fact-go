# contract-fact-go

This project provides Go smart contract examples and related resources specifically for the Casibase-based ChainMaker platform. It is intended for developers who wish to deploy and develop Go smart contracts on ChainMaker.

## Project Overview
This repository contains Go example contract source code, binary files, and ready-to-use compressed packages for the Casibase-based ChainMaker platform. It aims to provide reference and practical examples for developers. Through this project, you can learn how to write, compile, and deploy Go smart contracts supported by ChainMaker.

## Documentation
For information on how to deploy a ChainMaker node that supports Go smart contracts or how to write Go smart contracts, please refer to the official documentation:

[Developing Smart Contracts with Golang](https://docs.chainmaker.org.cn/instructions/%E4%BD%BF%E7%94%A8Golang%E8%BF%9B%E8%A1%8C%E6%99%BA%E8%83%BD%E5%90%88%E7%BA%A6%E5%BC%80%E5%8F%91.html)

## Notes
- When rewriting example smart contracts, please note that corresponding changes to the Casibase platform may be required. Make sure to adapt according to the actual platform version and requirements.
- Please strictly follow the official documentation for the compilation and deployment process to ensure compatibility and security of the contracts.

## Resource Description
This project also provides pre-compiled binary files and ready-to-use 7z compressed packages for quick integration and deployment by developers.
